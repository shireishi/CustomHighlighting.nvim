# CustomHighlighting.nvim
This Custom Highlighting plugin for Neovim works with vim-plug, but I haven't tested
it out for any other neovim plugin manager. 

## Insallation
To install this plugin, simply clone the git repository into your plugin folder and add
```vim
Plug 'shireishi/CustomHighlighting.nvim'
```
to your init.vim or
```lua
require'highlight'.start()
```
to your lua section/file.
